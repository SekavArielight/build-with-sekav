Yah, I finally wrote python code, after many months of waiting. I must say, it was fun.
I used W3Schools as the primary learning resource.

- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
- Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
- A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

## Reflection

Learning a new thing always gives you a fresh perspective of how things work.
