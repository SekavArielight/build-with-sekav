# Day 43

## Date: [ISO format: 2026-02-12]

## 📋 Today's Goals

- [ ] Restart my acme dashboard project on Next.js's documentation
- [ ] Watch a coding tutorial

## What I Learned

- Seeding a database means populating it with initial data.
- definitions.ts is where we manually define types that will be returned from a database.

## Reflection

I decided to stop waiting for the perfect time to start, and just start.
I was able to restart the acme dashboard project.
